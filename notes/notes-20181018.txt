From 18 Oct 2018 paper notes:

- Holes in viewport plates should be larger for more alignment slop; some of 
the plates are very difficult to remove due to rubbing on threads.

- Pump mounting brackets should be 1" rather than 1.5" wide, to avoid 
conflict with anything else attached to the 1" extrusion.

- Fan mounts need an adapter plate for 120mm fans (implemented as 6" fans).

- Cannot mount twist-style t-slot cable holders to 1" rail due to enclosure 
sheet metal extending past the edge of the extrusion; trim if possible.
