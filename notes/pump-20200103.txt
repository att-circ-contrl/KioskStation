The pump's holes are ovals 0.21" by 0.36" (so, #8 or #10 screws).
They're on the back end of the pump, not the faceplate end.
There needs to be at least 1.5" clearance from the holes for the back end of
the pump.
The flange the holes are in is about 0.26" thick. So, call it 1/4".
The holes are 4-1/4" apart.


Kiosk #1 has a PP slab 1-1/4" thick, with a 7/8" thick groove for the jar lip.
It has holes tapped for #8-32 with 1-3/4" clearance behind them.
The holes intersect the lip groove, with 3/8" tapped distance.

...So, kiosk #1 needs #8-32" pan-head screws that are 5/8" long.


Kiosks #2 and #3 mount the pump to a thinner metal plate using bolts.
Thread and length are unclear.
