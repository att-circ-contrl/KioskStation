I'm designing the v2 case as something that could be manufactured by
injection molding, in case we want lots of these.

The main difficulty is that it'll have to be 3 pieces rather than 2 pieces,
if we want the cable gland to enter through the end. Entering through a face
could be 2 pieces.


For injection molding, thickness should be uniform (if possible), with a
draft angle of about 4 degrees on vertical surfaces where practical.


For parts to be released from the mold (and for the molds to be machined),
each half of the mold has to be "2.5-d" (no undercuts). This means each half
of the part being made needs to be "2.5-d". "Flying saucer" (with the part
lin on the rim) and "bowl" (with the part line on the lip) shapes are
examples of this type of geometry.
