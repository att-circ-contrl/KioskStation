Executive summary:

- Pinout is on page 17 of the manual, control scheme is on page 21.
- Connector type is "M12" circular connector.

- Use their grey cable if possible (p/n 48414).
- White wire is ground, brown is _enable (short to ground), blue is pulse 
(short to ground; pump triggers on release). Black is +15v (use for power),
green is analog control (nc for this pump type).

- Max voltage 24 V, max current 15 mA. They used a 10 kOhm PD in their 
"adapter cable", so actual currents are likely much lower.
- Pulse times must be at least 50 ms.
