# "Kiosk Station" NHP Game Kiosk

## Overview

The "Kiosk Station" is an interactive game kiosk intended for use with
non-human primates. The kiosk is mounted to one module of an apartment-cage
(replacing one of the wall panels), allowing a monkey to freely play the
game without direct supervision.

**This repository is a work-in-progress.**
All of the CAD files and auxiliary information needed to make additional
"revision 2" kiosks should be present (in `drawings-ext/rev2-cad-2021`),
but organization could be better.
