# "Kiosk Station" NHP Game Kiosk

## Overview

The "Kiosk Station" is an interactive game kiosk intended for use with
non-human primates. The kiosk is mounted to one module of an apartment-cage
(replacing one of the wall panels), allowing a monkey to freely play the
game without direct supervision.

**This repository is a work-in-progress.** While the intention is to
provide all of the information and design files needed to make additional
kiosks, only a subset of that information is provided at present.

## Folders

This repository contains the following directories:

* `datasheets` -- Vendor-supplied datasheets. Under vendor copyright.
* `drawings-ext` --
CAD files and screenshots for the "Version 1" Kiosk Station (superseded
by the "Version 2" kiosk station).
* `drawings` -- Assorted mechanical drawings.
* `manual` --
LaTeX source and PDF output for the kiosk user manual (incomplete).

Materials relating to tests of proximity sensors that were to be mounted
on the sipper tube of the kiosk.
* `pump-box` --
Design documents for the control box for the LMI fluid pump used with the
kiosk. The intention is that TTL pulses or user-fob button presses can
trigger delivery of a fluid reward (water or juice) through the sipper tube.

Assorted reference documents (other than datasheets or vendor-supplied
materials).
